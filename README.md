The main purpose of the project was to experience end-to-end work. The underlying Linear Regression model is quite simple, but I've built out a fully functional CI/CD deployment pipeline using Docker, GitHub actions, and the popular PaaS Heroku to deploy the application which uses AWS as the underlying cloud infrastructure.

PLEASE NOTE this project is not currently deployed on Heroku. I spun it up as a POC but then shut it down to avoid paying for it monthly.
